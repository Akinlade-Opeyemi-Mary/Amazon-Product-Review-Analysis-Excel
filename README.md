# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis-Excel
üìä Excel Case Study  Analyzing Amazon product reviews to uncover insights on pricing, discounts, ratings, and customer engagement. Includes pivot tables, data cleaning, and an interactive Excel dashboard

# üìò INTRODUCTION

In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, customer reviews and pricing strategies play a crucial role in influencing buyer behavior. Sellers on platforms like **Amazon** must continuously analyze feedback, ratings, and product performance to stay competitive and improve sales outcomes.

This case study places me in the role of a **Junior Data Analyst** at *RetailTech Insights*, a company focused on delivering data-driven insights to online retailers. Leveraging Microsoft Excel, I explored a dataset of over **1,400 Amazon products** to uncover trends in ratings, review counts, pricing, and discounts.

The primary focus of this analysis was to answer key business questions, such as:

- üè∑Ô∏è Which product categories are performing best?  
- üìâ What is the relationship between discounts and customer ratings?  
- üí∞ How are products distributed across pricing ranges?  
- üéØ Where should sellers concentrate their efforts to boost engagement and revenue?

# üè¢ BACKGROUND

As a **Junior Data Analyst** at *RetailTech Insights*, a fictional e-commerce analytics company, I was tasked with analyzing product review data scraped from Amazon. This project simulates a real-world business analytics workflow from raw data preparation to visual dashboard delivery with the goal of guiding product strategy and performance evaluation for online sellers.

The analysis focuses on interpreting product metrics such as ratings, discount levels, review volume, and pricing. It aims to help businesses understand customer feedback trends, evaluate which products and categories are performing well, and discover how pricing and discount strategies influence customer behavior. Additionally, it highlights areas where marketing and promotional efforts can be optimized to improve sales performance.

This hands-on case study reflects the type of product intelligence work commonly required by e-commerce teams to remain competitive, data-driven, and customer focused in a saturated marketplace.

# üéØ Objectives

This analysis focused on generating actionable insights for e-commerce sellers using Amazon product review data. The key objectives were:

1. Determine the average discount percentage across different product categories.  
2. Identify how many products are listed within each category.  
3. Analyze the total number of customer reviews per product category.  
4. Find out which products have the highest average customer ratings.  
5. Compare the average actual price versus the discounted price across categories.  
6. Identify products with the highest number of reviews.  
7. Determine how many products offer discounts of 50% or more.  
8. Analyze the distribution of product ratings (e.g., 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, etc.).  
9. Calculate the total potential revenue per category using actual price and rating count.  
10. Classify products into price range buckets (e.g., under ‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, over ‚Çπ500) and count how many fall into each.  
11. Explore how discount levels correlate with customer ratings.  
12. Identify how many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews.  
13. Highlight which categories contain the highest-discounted products.  
14. Rank the top five products based on a combination of rating and review volume.

These objectives guided the creation of pivot tables, calculated columns, and visual dashboards that support better product positioning, pricing decisions, and customer engagement strategies.

## üõ† Tools Used for the Analysis

The entire analysis was conducted in **Microsoft Excel**, leveraging its data exploration, transformation, and visualization features to derive meaningful business insights from Amazon product review data.

- **Pivot Tables** were used extensively to summarize average discounts by category, count products, total review volumes, analyze rating distributions, and compare actual vs discounted prices.

- **Calculated Columns** were created to derive custom metrics such as:
  - `Discount Percentage`
  - `Revenue` (Actual Price √ó Rating Count)
  - `Price Bucket Range` (e.g., <‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, >‚Çπ500)

## 10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket?

üìå **Approach**:
- Grouped all products into **price range buckets**:
  - `< ‚Çπ200`
  - `‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500`
  - `> ‚Çπ500`
- Counted the number of **unique Product IDs** in each bucket to analyze pricing distribution.

üìà **Result**:

| Price Range | Number of Unique Products |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| `< ‚Çπ200` | 199 |
| `‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500` | 377 |
| `> ‚Çπ500` | 889 |

üîç **Key Findings**:
- A **majority (889 products)** fall into the **premium price range (> ‚Çπ500)**.
- The **mid-tier range (‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500)** contains a healthy spread of **377 products**.
- Only **199 products** are priced below ‚Çπ200, making low-cost items the smallest segment.

üí° **Insight**:
- The product catalog is **heavily skewed toward higher-priced items**, which may suggest a **focus on quality or high-value goods**.
- Mid-tier products represent a **balanced offering**, while the low-end may present **missed opportunities for price-sensitive consumers**.

üéØ **Business Implication**:
- **Expand or promote the low-cost segment** (< ‚Çπ200) to attract budget-conscious customers or new market entrants.
- **Bundle mid-tier items** to create value deals and increase volume sales.

- Focused on identifying if higher-rated products tend to receive more, less, or equal discount treatment.

üìà **Result**:
- Total Products Analyzed: **1,465**
- The distribution did **not reveal a strong correlation** between product rating and discount levels.
- Products across all rating bands (3.0 to 4.8) showed a **wide range of discount percentages**, indicating **inconsistent discounting strategy**.

üîç **Key Findings**:
- Both highly-rated (4.5+) and moderately-rated (3.5‚Äì4.2) products received **similar discount treatments**.
- Some **lower-rated products** (<3.5) were also heavily discounted, possibly as an incentive to boost sales or clear inventory.

üí° **Insight**:
- **Product discounting appears to be independent of product rating**, which might suggest that discounts are driven more by marketing campaigns, inventory turnover, or product lifecycle stages than customer satisfaction.

## 12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?

üìå **Approach**:
- Filtered the dataset to identify products with **less than 1,000 reviews**.
- Counted unique products within this threshold.

üìà **Result**:
- **1,465 products** have fewer than **1,000 customer reviews**.

üîç **Key Findings**:
- A significant portion of the catalog has **limited customer feedback**, suggesting low engagement or recent market entry.
- These products may lack sufficient review volume to build customer trust and influence buying decisions.

üí° **Insight**:
- There is a **huge opportunity for sellers to boost visibility and trust** for the majority of products by encouraging more user reviews through post-purchase follow-ups, incentives, or better marketing visibility.

## 13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?

üìå **Approach**:
- Grouped products by category.
- Calculated the **maximum discount percentage** per category.

üìà **Result**:
Displayed below is a pivot table of the top categories offering the **highest discounts**, with values ranging from **80% to 94%**.

üîç **Key Findings**:
- Some niche electronics and accessory categories offer discounts as high as **90‚Äì94%**.
- Examples include **USB to USB Adapters**, **Smartwatches**, **Earpads**, and **Phone Charms**.
- These high discounts are concentrated in **tech accessories**, **mobile add-ons**, and **home gadgets**.

üí° **Insight**:
- These categories may be **highly competitive**, **overstocked**, or driven by **aggressive price promotions** to boost sales volume.
- A potential **marketing strategy** might focus on bundling or upselling such high-discount items.

## 14. Identify the Top 5 Products in Terms of Rating and Number of Reviews Combined

üìå **Approach**:
- Ranked products by a **combined metric**: number of reviews √ó average rating.
- Selected the **top 5 products** with the highest combined influence.
