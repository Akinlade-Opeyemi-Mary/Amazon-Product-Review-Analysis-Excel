# üìò INTRODUCTION

In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, customer reviews and pricing strategies play a crucial role in influencing buyer behavior. Sellers on platforms like **Amazon** must continuously analyze feedback, ratings, and product performance to stay competitive and improve sales outcomes.

This case study places me in the role of a **Junior Data Analyst** at *RetailTech Insights*, a company focused on delivering data-driven insights to online retailers. Leveraging Microsoft Excel, I explored a dataset of over **1,400 Amazon products** to uncover trends in ratings, review counts, pricing, and discounts.

The primary focus of this analysis was to answer key business questions, such as:

- üè∑Ô∏è Which product categories are performing best?  
- üìâ What is the relationship between discounts and customer ratings?  
- üí∞ How are products distributed across pricing ranges?  
- üéØ Where should sellers concentrate their efforts to boost engagement and revenue?

# üè¢ BACKGROUND

As a **Junior Data Analyst** at *RetailTech Insights*, a fictional e-commerce analytics company, I was tasked with analyzing product review data scraped from Amazon. This project simulates a real-world business analytics workflow from raw data preparation to visual dashboard delivery with the goal of guiding product strategy and performance evaluation for online sellers.

The analysis focuses on interpreting product metrics such as ratings, discount levels, review volume, and pricing. It aims to help businesses understand customer feedback trends, evaluate which products and categories are performing well, and discover how pricing and discount strategies influence customer behavior. Additionally, it highlights areas where marketing and promotional efforts can be optimized to improve sales performance.

This hands-on case study reflects the type of product intelligence work commonly required by e-commerce teams to remain competitive, data-driven, and customer focused in a saturated marketplace.

# üéØ Objectives

This analysis focused on generating actionable insights for e-commerce sellers using Amazon product review data. The key objectives were:

1. Determine the average discount percentage across different product categories.  
2. Identify how many products are listed within each category.  
3. Analyze the total number of customer reviews per product category.  
4. Find out which products have the highest average customer ratings.  
5. Compare the average actual price versus the discounted price across categories.  
6. Identify products with the highest number of reviews.  
7. Determine how many products offer discounts of 50% or more.  
8. Analyze the distribution of product ratings (e.g., 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, etc.).  
9. Calculate the total potential revenue per category using actual price and rating count.  
10. Classify products into price range buckets (e.g., under ‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, over ‚Çπ500) and count how many fall into each.  
11. Explore how discount levels correlate with customer ratings.  
12. Identify how many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews.  
13. Highlight which categories contain the highest-discounted products.  
14. Rank the top five products based on a combination of rating and review volume.

These objectives guided the creation of pivot tables, calculated columns, and visual dashboards that support better product positioning, pricing decisions, and customer engagement strategies.
