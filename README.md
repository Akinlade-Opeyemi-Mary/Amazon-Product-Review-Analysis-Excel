📊 Excel Case Study  Analyzing Amazon product reviews to uncover insights on pricing, discounts, ratings, and customer engagement. Includes pivot tables, data cleaning, and an interactive Excel dashboard

# 📘 Introduction

In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, customer reviews and pricing strategies play a crucial role in influencing buyer behavior. Sellers on platforms like **Amazon** must continuously analyze feedback, ratings, and product performance to stay competitive and improve sales outcomes.

This case study places me in the role of a **Junior Data Analyst** at *RetailTech Insights*, a company focused on delivering data-driven insights to online retailers. Leveraging Microsoft Excel, I explored a dataset of over **1,400 Amazon products** to uncover trends in ratings, review counts, pricing, and discounts.

The primary focus of this analysis was to answer key business questions, such as:

- 🏷️ Which product categories are performing best?  
- 📉 What is the relationship between discounts and customer ratings?  
- 💰 How are products distributed across pricing ranges?  
- 🎯 Where should sellers concentrate their efforts to boost engagement and revenue?
